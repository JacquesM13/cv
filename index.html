    <h2 class="summary">Summary</h2>
    <p class="summary">Since I was a child I've always dabbled in different areas of interest, and I've become something of a Jacques of All Trades. I played tennis, golf, football, cricket, and hockey, as well as going swimming twice a week. In retrospect, I think my mum just wanted me out of the house, as I always had lots of energy and needed something to do. Later in life, I've developed keen interests in a variety of topics of study. I'm interested in technology, politics - especially US, geography, history, physics, maths, zoology, and geology. This can present issues for me, as there's only so much time in the day - and while engaged in one area of interest, I can become drawn to look into another - but it's also a great strength. Because of the breadth of my interests, I can really appreciate the world from all sorts of different angles. </p>
    <p class="summary">In summary... my interests are vast, my past-times assorted, and my mind scattered. So, I'm going to seek to make here a centre for all things Jacques. Some ideas:</p>
